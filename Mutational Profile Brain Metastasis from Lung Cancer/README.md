# RNA-Seq and Mutational Profile Analysis of Brain Metastasis from Lung Adenocarcinoma

In this project, I analyzed RNA-Seq data and the mutational profile of brain metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The results were part of my PhD at São Paulo State University (UNESP), Brazil, under the guidance of Dr. Patricia Pintor Reis.

## Key Highlights:
- **Focus**: RNA-Seq analysis and mutational profiling of LUAD brain metastasis.
- **Institution**: São Paulo State University (UNESP), Brazil.
- **Research Supervision**: Dr. Patricia Pintor Reis.
- **Conference Presentation**: The findings were presented at the 66th Brazilian Congress of Genetics, held in Natal, Brazil, in 2021.
- **Publication**: The full proceedings of the conference can be accessed here: [66th Brazilian Congress of Genetics - Proceedings](https://www.sbg.org.br/anais).

## Overview:
This project involved the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data to understand the genetic and molecular landscape of brain metastases in LUAD. The focus was on identifying specific mutations and gene expression profiles that could contribute to the metastatic process and potentially guide therapeutic interventions.

## Repository Contents:
- **RNA-Seq analysis scripts**: Scripts for processing and analyzing the sequencing data.
- **Mutational profile analysis**: Code for mutational analysis and comparison between tumor and normal tissues.
- **Data**: Processed RNA-Seq datasets
