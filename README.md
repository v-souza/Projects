# Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Projects** repository, where I share various scripts and tools developed for my scientific research projects in the field of **cancer genomics and transcriptomics**.

Here youâ€™ll find a variety of scripts in **Shell**, **R**, and **Python**, which serve as the backbone for the processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale transcriptomic/Genomic datasets. 

## Key Highlights:
- **RNA-Seq Data Processing:** From raw sequencing data to quality control and downstream analysis.
- **Differential Gene Expression:** Comprehensive analysis of gene expression across different conditions.
- **Mutational Profiling:** Insightful analysis of genomic alterations in various contexts.
- **Visualization:** High-quality plots and graphs to represent complex data in an understandable format.
- **Automation and Scripting:** Use of **Shell** and **Python** for workflow automation and large dataset management.

## Programming Languages and Tools:
- **R and RStudio**: For advanced statistical analysis, visualization (e.g., ggplot2, DESeq2, edgeR), and custom pipelines.
- **Python**: For data manipulation, statistical analysis.
- **Shell**: For automating data preprocessing, quality control, and file handling in high-throughput sequencing workflows.
