# Genomic Sequencing of the Arcuate Nucleus in the Hypothalamus of Exercised Mice

In this project, I analyzed RNA-Seq data from the hypothalamus of exercised mice, specifically focusing on the arcuate nucleus. This research was conducted in collaboration with Prof. Eduardo Rochete Ropelle from Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.

## Key Highlights:
- **Focus**: RNA-Seq analysis of the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus of exercised mice.
- **Collaboration**: Prof. Eduardo Rochete Ropelle, Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Exercise (LaBMEx), School of Applied Sciences, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Limeira, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- **Conference Presentation**: The results were presented in a poster format at the Cell Symposia: Exercise Metabolism, Lisbon, Portugal, 2024.
- **Event Link**: [Cell Symposia: Exercise Metabolism 2024](https://www.cell-symposia.com/exercisemetabolism-2024/).

## Overview:
This project aimed to investigate the transcriptional changes in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in response to exercise. RNA-Seq was used to identify differentially expressed genes and potential pathways involved in exercise-induced metabolic regulation.

## Repository Contents:
- **RNA-Seq analysis scripts**: Scripts for processing and analyzing RNA-Seq data.
- **Data**: Processed RNA-Seq datasets (if available and shareable).
- **Figures**: Visualizations and plots from the study (e.g., heatmaps, differential expression).
